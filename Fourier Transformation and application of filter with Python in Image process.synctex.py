# Thanks again for reading this script to the end(I hope someone did), thanks 
# again for such a great course I take this year, I know there's still several 
# filter out there, for example, Guassian Filter, Mean Filter, Median Filter 
# and so on, but I choose to not proceed too far this time. As the most target 
# has already completed among the progress.However, I found that finding out 
# these filter and developing something by oneself is really something enjoyable.
# Just as a suggestion, probably that is a good assignment for next year student
# as some of the student might from engineer or study signal analysis, that's 
# really helpful.Thanks again for being such a great course now.orz
